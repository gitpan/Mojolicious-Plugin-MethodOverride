Revision history for Mojolicious-Plugin-MethodOverride

0.041	2015-01-07
        - Remove test "method override for static files":
          POST static_file must not be possible, but this was fixed in
          Mojolicious 5.30. OTOH method overriding does no harm if the
          HTTP method is completely ignored for static files before 5.30.
